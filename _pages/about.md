Hi, my name is Wenwei Liao. I am currently a Master's student in Civil Environmental Engineering at Duke University.

- **ResearchÔºö**
- 1.Modeling and Data Analysis: My focus is on the application of modeling and data analysis across various scientific and environmental areas.
- 2.Machine Learning in Environmental Science: I am particularly interested in using machine learning for climate and meteorological data prediction and analysis, with applications in hydrology and fluid dynamics.
- 3.Wastewater Treatment: My interests here include both chemical and biological methods of wastewater treatment, as well as the modeling and data analysis of these processes.
- 4.Chemical Material Development: I am engaged in the characterization and performance analysis of graphene nanomaterials, their preparation, mechanism studies, and the application of nanomaterials in wastewater treatment.
- 5.Microbial Pollution Treatment: This includes my work in cultivating and screening microbes for pollution treatment and the production of biofuels.
- 6.Education in Mathematics and Sciences: I have a keen interest in teaching calculus, AP and A-Level mathematics, physics, statistics, and probability. My focus is on foundational K12 education and talent cultivation, with a special interest in the applications of calculus, probability, and physics.
- 7.Java Web Development and Algorithm/Data Structure Research: I am also involved in web development using Java and in researching algorithms and data structures.
- 8.Agricultural Pollution: I am concerned with soil and water pollution from the overuse of fertilizers, and air pollution from burning straw, contributing to CO2 emissions. My interest extends to agricultural development and food security.
-Among these, my primary interests lie in the first two areas, though I am also keen on interdisciplinary applications.

**Additional Interests:**
- 1.Culinary Arts: I enjoy cooking, finding it similar to conducting chemical experiments. I have a talent for recreating dishes from memory.
- 2.Sports: As an avid runner and fitness enthusiast, I appreciate the physical and mental benefits these activities offer. I also enjoy various sports like table tennis, basketball, tennis, and outdoor activities like hiking.
- 3.Travel: I have extensively traveled within China, enjoying learning about different cultures, histories, and meeting new people.
- 4.Business: My experience includes running businesses, with one focused on environmental protection, offering consultancy and environmental impact assessment services, and another in the education sector, focusing on math and academic training.
